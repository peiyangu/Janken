# Janken
This is a program that can recognize hands in the screen using Mediapipe and play rock-paper-scissors with the computer.

To actually do this, run jankenProject.py.
This program was developed in a virtual environment, so it may not run properly.

Note that at this stage, you can only play rock-paper-scissors with your left hand.
